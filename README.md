## Projects

### **Project 1: Course Management System (AI Integrated Project)**

**Description**:  
This full-stack project involves several sub-projects, each contributing to the overall Course Management System with Django backend and React frontend. Below are the key sub-projects:

### **Technologies Used**

Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), React.js, Redux (state management), OpenAI API, Celery



#### **1. User Authentication**
- **Backend**: Implement user authentication using Django's JWT-based system (`djangorestframework-simplejwt`).
- **Frontend**: Develop login and registration pages in React, integrating with Django APIs using Axios.
- **Features**: Secure user login, registration, and token-based authentication.

#### **2. Course Management (CRUD Operations)**
- **Backend**: Create a `Course` model with fields like title, description, and video URL. Implement RESTful APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting courses.
- **Frontend**: Build React components for listing, adding, editing, and deleting courses.
- **Features**: Course management with interactive UI for users to manage courses.

#### **3. Activity Logging with MongoDB**
- **Backend**: Integrate MongoDB using `pymongo` to store activity logs (e.g., courses viewed).
- **Frontend**: Display activity logs in React, fetching them from MongoDB.
- **Features**: Track user activity for personalized experience and analytics.

#### **4. AI-Powered Quiz Generation**
- **Backend**: Use OpenAI's API to generate quiz questions based on course content. Build APIs to handle quiz generation and submissions.
- **Frontend**: Create a quiz page in React where users can take quizzes generated by AI.
- **Features**: Automated quiz generation to enhance learning experience.

#### **5. AI-Powered Course Recommendations**
- **Backend**: Implement a recommendation algorithm based on user behavior and activity logs.
- **Frontend**: Display recommended courses on the React homepage, personalized for each user.
- **Features**: Personalized course suggestions using AI for a better user experience.

#### **6. Progress Tracking**
- **Backend**: Create a model for tracking user progress on courses. Implement APIs to fetch and update progress data.
- **Frontend**: Build a progress dashboard in React to display user progress in real-time.
- **Features**: Track user progress, showing how much of each course they’ve completed.

#### **7. Email Notifications**
- **Backend**: Integrate Django’s email backend to send notifications to users for course updates, progress, and quizzes.
- **Frontend**: Ensure that users are notified about updates directly through email.
- **Features**: Real-time email notifications based on course updates and user activities.

#### **8. Frontend-Backend Communication with Axios**
- **Backend**: Expose APIs to handle data requests between frontend and backend.
- **Frontend**: Use Axios to handle HTTP requests and integrate with Django APIs.
- **Features**: Seamless interaction between frontend and backend to fetch course, quiz, and user data.
